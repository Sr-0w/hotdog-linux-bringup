# NFC: the controller is described and binds - 2026-08-10

## Result

The NFC controller is described, the upstream driver binds it, and an `nfc0`
adapter appears. Powering the adapter does not complete, so no tag has been read
yet.

## Starting point

Nothing described NFC at all: no `nfc` class, no driver loaded, and no I2C
device beyond the touchscreen, Hall sensors, amplifiers, fuel gauge and cameras.

The stock device tree has it. On the bus mainline calls `i2c9`:

```
soc/i2c@a84000/nq@28   compatible = "qcom,nq-nci"
    qcom,nq-irq     = tlmm 47
    qcom,nq-ven     = tlmm 41
    qcom,nq-firm    = tlmm 48
    qcom,nq-esepwr  = tlmm 42
    qcom,nq-clkreq  = tlmm 113
```

`qcom,nq-nci` is the vendor binding for an NXP NQ part. Upstream has
`nxp,nxp-nci-i2c`, which wants the same interrupt, enable and firmware lines, and
the kernel here already builds `CONFIG_NFC_NXP_NCI_I2C` and the NCI core.

## The change

`0127` enables `i2c9` and describes the controller with the three lines the
upstream binding takes. The secure-element power and clock-request lines are left
out deliberately: nothing upstream consumes them, and the secure element is a
separate question from reader mode.

## Result on hardware

```
/sys/class/nfc/nfc0
/sys/class/nfc/nfc0/device/name -> nxp-nci-i2c

nxp_nci_i2c   12288  0
nxp_nci       12288  1 nxp_nci_i2c
nci           40960  2 nxp_nci,nxp_nci_i2c
```

`neard` sees the adapter and lists its protocols:

```
nfc0:  Protocols: [ Felica MIFARE Jewel ISO-DEP NFC-DEP ]
       Powered: No
```

## Where it stops

Setting `Powered` to true on the adapter does not return. The NCI core reset is
not completing, so the controller is not answering as expected over I2C. One
attempt left the handset wedged enough that it rebooted.

Things worth checking, none of them tested yet: whether `enable-gpios` should be
active low rather than active high, whether the firmware-download line needs to
be held low during reset rather than merely configured, and whether the
clock-request line the stock tree describes is in fact required for the
controller's reference clock.

The kernel also logs, harmlessly and only at boot, `udevd: nxp-nci.ko error=No
such file or directory`, which is udev trying to load the module before the
module tree is mounted; it loads later on its own.
